/*
ðŸ’¡ You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.

Count and return *the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations*

Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]

Output: 4

Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
